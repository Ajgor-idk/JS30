### Progress Note ###
Already knew fetch and howit works, but ofcourse never enoght practice. I'm starting to grab some more idea how the match works it's still not 100% clear, but that's work in progress (Regex is wierd). The findCities fn was not 100% my idea but I had thought about some thnigs in it which were then applied and the was done only by me. Chceked it and it was something different on a video I liked that matchArray const with more clean than my previous idea. Only thing there that I haven't thought of is this highlight it's done cool.
