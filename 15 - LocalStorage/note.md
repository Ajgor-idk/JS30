### Progress Note ###
Really nice excercise with local storage. I knew something about it but now I know more how it works and why many things work like they work. Event delegation is also very interesting subject don't quite understand it that match but I think it's just the confirmation of the element we clicking or we're working on so the event doesn't do anything to any more elements than it needs to. Long story short we delegate the event so it needs to confirm we're working on what we want only. Need to remember about the personal challange to add buttons that clear, check and uncheck all.
