### Progress Note ###
Really cool excercise. I watch and coded along, but drawing and mapping mouse position was totally new so I rather learn now and then tets by myself. Need to use more booleans in my future projects cuz they can help a lot.

### Future Project Idea ###
- Hangman
- skribbl.io (clone)
