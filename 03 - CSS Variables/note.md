###Progress Note###

First mistake that I made is I didn't select all inputs. I wanted to make it individually just because of habit. Next thime need to think more about making more sufficient code from start. If I had to make practically whole new script it would be a disaster maybe not here but on large scale projects. Nice thing with the move mouse I would have to google it when I selected them I started to thing how to make'em update all the time. Another small mistake that can cost sime time is to remember to write "dataset" not "dataSet". And really nice thing whit suffix not to make them undefined. It was a nice lesson on how to change the CSS vars I did it by myslef for the most part except as I said I didn't know about dataset and other small things but I think I'd manage to do it by myslef without googling how to do it and only trying to solve those small problems.
